1. understand the code DONE
2. divide code into different files
--> replace EVENT with something that is supported, EVENT is deprecated DONE (erased function)
3. comment the code and translate into german
4. design new art for the game (ghost, pacman, power-ups) ONLY POWER-UPS MISSING
5. change the game logic
    5.1 make a new, bigger map DONE
    5.2 insert power_ups and other things
    5.3 portal, side to side DONE
    5.4 "smart" ghosts NICE
    5.5 new point counting system and make game more difficult NOT NEEDED
6. finalize the game and explain it to polar bear

7. optional -> add sound to the game, and a leaderboard (stored locally) I DONT KNOW


Make code more readable and understanding it:
-> make a pacman class DOES IT MAKE SENSE? | SOMEWHAT -> IMAGES ARE ALREADY INSIDE
-> create a ghost class DONE
-> make the code work with the new "data" DONE FOR GHOSTS
-> divide things for GUI, logic and other things into multiple files CISS


-> man muss eine Art von Mauer einf체hren >> Geister, die Spawnen d체rfen nicht aus dem Feld heraus
-> Irgendwie die Fr체chte einbauen, das w채re cool
