2. divide code into different files
--> replace EVENT with something that is supported, EVENT is deprecated DONE (erased function)
3. comment the code and translate into german
4. design new art for the game (ghost, pacman, power-ups) ONLY POWER-UPS MISSING
5. change the game logic
    5.2 insert power_ups and other things
    5.4 "smart" ghosts NICE
6. finalize the game and explain it to polar bear

7. optional -> add sound to the game, and a leaderboard (stored locally) I DONT KNOW


Make code more readable and understanding it:
-> make a pacman class DOES IT MAKE SENSE? | SOMEWHAT -> IMAGES ARE ALREADY INSIDE
-> make the code work with the new "data" DONE FOR GHOSTS
-> divide things for GUI, logic and other things into multiple files CISS


-> man muss eine Art von Mauer einführen >> Geister, die Spawnen dürfen nicht aus dem Feld heraus
