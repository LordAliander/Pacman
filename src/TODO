1. understand the code
2. divide code into different files
--> replace EVENT with something that is supported, EVENT is deprecated
3. comment the code and translate into german
4. design new art for the game (ghost, pacman, power-ups)
5. change the game logic
    5.1 make a new, bigger map
    5.2 insert power_ups and other things
    5.3 portal, side to side
    5.4 "smart" ghosts
    5.5 new point counting system and make game more difficult
6. finalize the game and explain it to polar bear

7. optional -> add sound to the game, and a leaderboard (stored locally)


Make code more readable and understanding it:
-> make a pacman class
-> create a ghost class
-> make the code work with the new "data"
-> divide things for GUI, logic and other things into multiple files
